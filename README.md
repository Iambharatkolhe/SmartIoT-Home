# Automated Light Control and Bill Prediction

## Overview:
This project automates the control of an LED light based on human presence detected by a PIR motion sensor and an ultrasonic sensor. It also predicts the bill for electricity usage based on the time the light is on.

## Components Needed:
- Arduino Uno (or any compatible Arduino board)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (for distance measurement)
- PIR Motion Sensor (for detecting motion)
- LED (to simulate a light bulb)
- 220Î© Resistor (for LED current limiting)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Working:
- The light (LED) turns on when motion is detected by the PIR sensor or if someone is detected by the ultrasonic sensor (distance below a certain threshold).
- If no movement is detected for a specified timeout (2 seconds), the light turns off automatically.
- The system keeps track of how long the light has been on and calculates the electricity bill based on the time the light has been on, assuming a cost per second.

## Pin Connections:
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04):**
  - Trigger Pin -> Arduino Pin 9
  - Echo Pin -> Arduino Pin 10

- **PIR Sensor:**
  - Output Pin -> Arduino Pin 8

- **LED (Light):**
  - LED Pin -> Arduino Pin 13

## Code Explanation:

1. **Setup:**
   - Set pin modes for the ultrasonic sensor, PIR sensor, and LED.
   - Start serial communication for debugging.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The PIR sensor checks for movement and turns the light on when motion is detected.
   - The ultrasonic sensor measures distance and turns the light on if the distance is below a threshold.
   - If no movement is detected for 2 seconds, the light is turned off.
   - The code also calculates the total time the light has been on and estimates the electricity cost based on that.

3. **Bill Prediction:**
   - The bill is calculated by multiplying the total light-on time by a predefined cost per second.
   - Every 2 seconds, the predicted bill is printed on the Serial Monitor.
